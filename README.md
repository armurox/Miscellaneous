# Tic-Tac-Toe
This program is a simple game of tic-tac-toe implemented using the algorithm minimax, created using the Python library Pygame. To start the game, you choose whether to play as the X or O player upon opening the program. The computer is programmed to take the same time to make moves as a human player, based on its own AI. The game ends once a player has won or there is a tie, in which case the user is asked to play again.

## Features:
- Choose to play as either the X or O player
- Computer takes the same amount of time as a human player
- Play against the computer
- Computer always plays optimally, so the best you can do is obtain a tie (good for practise!)
- Uses minimax algorithm

## Requirements:
- Python 3.7
- Pygame library

To run the program, open a command line and enter the command `python tictactoe.py`. Enjoy the game!
